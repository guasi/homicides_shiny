#### Observations

Historical charts show homicide rates seem to be declining in all regions except in the Americas, where rates have stayed the same for the last twenty years.

Density charts differentiate the distribution by region. We can see that in the Americas many countries have high rates, the distribution is spread out. In contrast, in Europe the vast majority of countries have very low rates with just a few with high rates. The "tear drop" or "violin" charts show how stark the difference is between regions. This difference can also be seen on the map.
